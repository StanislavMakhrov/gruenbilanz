description: Create and (optionally) merge a GitHub pull request using wrapper scripts (preferred) or GitHub CLI (fallback), following the repo policy for rebase and merge.
compatibility: Preferred: scripts/pr-github.sh wrapper. Fallback: git + GitHub CLI (gh) authenticated, plus network access.

# Create PR (GitHub)

## Purpose
Create a GitHub pull request in a consistent, policy-compliant way, and include the repo's preferred merge method guidance (rebase and merge).

PRs are created as **drafts** to avoid triggering PR Validation before work is complete.
Once all commits are pushed, call `scripts/pr-github.sh mark-ready` to convert the draft
to ready-for-review — this is the single trigger for PR Validation.

**Priority order:**
1. **FIRST**: Use `scripts/pr-github.sh` wrapper script (designed for permanent approval)
2. **SECOND**: Use GitHub MCP tools (if available and wrapper doesn't fit)
3. **LAST**: Use `gh` CLI as final fallback

## Hard Rules
### Must
- Work on a non-`main` branch
- Ensure the working tree is clean before creating a PR
- Push the branch to `origin` before creating the PR
- Before creating the PR, post the **exact Title and Description** in chat
- Use the standard PR body template (Problem / Change / Verification / Screenshots)
- Use **Rebase and merge** for merging PRs to maintain a linear history (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Call `scripts/pr-github.sh mark-ready` after creating the PR to trigger PR Validation

### Must Not
- Create PRs from `main`
- Use "Squash and merge" or "Create a merge commit"
- Use `--fill` or any heuristic that guesses title/body (not supported by the wrapper)

## Actions

### 0. Title + Description (Required)
Before running any PR creation command, provide in chat:

- **PR title** (exact)
- **PR description** (exact), using this template:

```markdown
## Problem
<why is this change needed?>

## Change
<what changed?>

## Verification
<how was it validated?>

## Screenshots
<!-- Optional: include if docs/features/NNN-.../screenshots/ exists.
     Use relative paths — GitHub renders them correctly in PR body from the branch.
     Omit this section entirely for non-visual changes. -->
```

### 1. Pre-flight Checks
```bash
git branch --show-current
scripts/git-status.sh --short
```

### 2. Push the Branch
```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### 3. Create the PR (as Draft)

#### Preferred: Wrapper Script
Create a draft PR:
```bash
echo "## Summary\n\nPR description" | scripts/pr-github.sh create --title "<type(scope): summary>" --body-from-stdin
```

Create and merge (only when explicitly requested — skips draft; use for release/internal PRs):
```bash
echo "## Summary\n\nPR description" | scripts/pr-github.sh create-and-merge --title "<type(scope): summary>" --body-from-stdin
```

#### Fallback: `gh` CLI (if wrapper unavailable)
```bash
echo "## Summary\n\nPR description" | PAGER=cat gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --head "$(git branch --show-current)" \
  --title "<type(scope): summary>" \
  --body-file - \
  --draft
```

### 4. Mark PR as Ready (Triggers PR Validation)

After creating the draft PR, convert it to ready-for-review. This is what triggers the
PR Validation pipeline — **do not skip this step**.

#### Preferred: Wrapper Script
```bash
scripts/pr-github.sh mark-ready
```

#### Fallback: `gh` CLI
```bash
PAGER=cat gh pr ready <pr-number>
```

### 5. Merge (Only When Explicitly Requested)
This repository requires **rebase and merge**.

Wait for PR Validation to pass (green ✅) before merging.

#### Preferred: Wrapper Script
```bash
scripts/pr-github.sh merge <pr-number>
```

Or combined create-and-merge (non-draft, for release/internal PRs only):
```bash
echo "## Summary\n\nPR description" | scripts/pr-github.sh create-and-merge --title "<type(scope): summary>" --body-from-stdin
```

#### Fallback: `gh` CLI (if wrapper unavailable)
```bash
PAGER=cat gh pr merge <pr-number> --rebase --delete-branch
```

### 6. If Rebase-Merge Is Blocked (Conflicts)
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
# resolve conflicts

git push --force-with-lease
```

Then retry the merge.

## Why Prefer the Wrapper Script?

- Designed for permanent approval in VS Code (reduces friction)
- Enforces repo policies (rebase and merge, standard templates)
- Handles edge cases consistently
- Provides clear error messages
- Can be easily reproduced by Maintainers

## Note on GitHub MCP Tools

GitHub MCP tools may be available for PR creation in the future, but currently the wrapper script is the most reliable approach. If GitHub MCP tools add PR creation support, they would become the preferred option (with wrapper as fallback).
