# GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Configuration

This repository uses GitHub Copilot coding agents for automated development workflows. This document describes the required repository configuration.

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Copilot Pro+** (or Enterprise) subscription
- Copilot coding agent enabled in repository settings
- **`COPILOT_TOKEN` secret** — a classic Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope,
  stored as an **Environment secret** in the `copilot` environment
  (**Settings → Environments → copilot → Environment secrets → COPILOT_TOKEN**).
  This is required for the agent to create pull requests.
  Without it, PR creation will fail with a 403 error.
  > **Note:** This is separate from `RELEASE_TOKEN`, which is used by the release pipeline.

## How It Works

1. **Setup Workflow**: `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`
   - Runs before the coding agent starts working
   - Installs Node.js 20 and npm dependencies

2. **Agent Definitions**: `.github/agents/*.agent.md`
   - Define agent roles, tools, and instructions
   - Auto-discovered by GitHub Copilot from the repository

3. **Agent Skills**: `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`
   - Reusable workflows for common tasks (PR creation, testing, releases)

## Usage

1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Go to **Settings → Copilot → Coding agent → ON**
3. Create an issue and assign it to `@copilot`, or open a session from the Agents tab / Copilot chat
4. The workflow orchestrator agent delegates work to specialized agents automatically
5. When all work is pushed and CI is green, the agent automatically creates the pull request

## UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

UAT is performed manually by the Maintainer using Docker:
1. The UAT Tester agent builds the Docker image (`docker build`)
2. The Maintainer runs `docker run` and verifies the feature at http://localhost:3000
3. The Maintainer replies PASS or FAIL

No special tokens, separate repositories, or environments are required for UAT.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent cannot push code

Ensure the repository has GitHub Actions enabled and the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `contents: write` permission.

### Agent cannot create pull requests (403 error)

The Copilot agent's built-in OAuth token (`ghu_`) is blocked from creating PRs by GitHub's
integration policy. The fix:

1. Create a classic PAT with `repo` scope at **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens**
2. Store it as an **Environment secret** named `COPILOT_TOKEN` in the `copilot` environment:
   **Settings → Environments → copilot → Environment secrets → Add secret → `COPILOT_TOKEN`**
   > ⚠️ Do **not** store it as a repository secret (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`).
   > The Copilot agent only has access to secrets from the `copilot` environment.
3. The `copilot-setup-steps.yml` workflow exposes `COPILOT_TOKEN` as `GH_TOKEN` via:
   - `$GITHUB_ENV` — for subsequent GitHub Actions steps in the same job
   - `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile` — for the agent's interactive bash sessions (which start fresh and don't inherit `$GITHUB_ENV`)

   This ensures the agent's `gh` commands use the PAT.

### Verifying PR creation works

To confirm the agent can create PRs, assign an issue to `@copilot` and check that the
agent completes a session ending with a new PR. A successful PR creation confirms:

- `COPILOT_TOKEN` secret is set correctly
- `GH_TOKEN` is visible in the agent's bash session (via `~/.bashrc`/`~/.profile`)
- The `scripts/pr-github.sh create` command exits without a 403 error
